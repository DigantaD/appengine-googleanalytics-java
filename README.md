Integrating App Engine with Google Analytics

## Project setup, installation, and configuration

- Register for [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), create
an application, and get a tracking id.
- Call *setGoogleAnalyticsTrackingId()* once with the Google Analytics tracking
id of your application before making calls to *trackEventToGoogleAnalytics()*
to tracking events.

## Running the demo

- Modify the *tracking.jsp* to use your own tracking id if you wish to test
tracking events to your own account.
